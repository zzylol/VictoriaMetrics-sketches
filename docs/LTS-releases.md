# Long-term support releases

[Enterprise version of VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/enterprise/) provides long-term support lines of releases (aka LTS releases).
Every LTS line receives bugfixes and [security fixes](https://github.com/zzylol/VictoriaMetrics-sketches/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for 12 months after
the initial release. New LTS lines are published every 6 months, so the latest two LTS lines are supported at any given moment. This gives up to 6 months
for the migration to new LTS lines for [VictoriaMetrics Enterprise](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/enterprise/) users.

All the bugfixes and security fixes, which are included in LTS releases, are also available in [the latest release](https://github.com/zzylol/VictoriaMetrics-sketches/releases/latest),
so non-enterprise users are advised to regularly [upgrade](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#how-to-upgrade-victoriametrics) VictoriaMetrics products
to [the latest available releases](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/changelog/).
