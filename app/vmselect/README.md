`vmselect` performs the incoming queries and fetches the required data
from `vmstorage`.

The `vmui` directory contains static contents built from [app/vmui](https://github.com/zzylol/VictoriaMetrics-sketches/tree/master/app/vmui) package with `make vmui-update` command. The `vmui` page is available at `http://<victoria-metrics>:8428/vmui/`.
